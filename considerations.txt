To Consider : 
--------------
1. Changing Status of class while in certain status logically
2. Registering subscriber in non existing or inactive class
3. Adding Logs for action, from API gateway level or from core

4. Setting IDs of portal user and subscriber to differ depending on starting number , e.g. subscriber start from 10000, while portal start from 4000, this will enhance foreign key constraint
5.Each Transaction shall be validated with validity of UDID and user, as well as shall be middleware to check limit


adding services and service providers



TO DO TOMORROW :
- LIMIT & FLOAT CONTROL middleware(TRANSACTION MIDDLEWARE)
- TRANSACTIONS(ALL->AC/TRANSFER/PAYMENTS ETC) MANAGEMENT//

Transaction Checks ;-
- Is Service Active and limit obeyed for particular customer class ?
- Is Float enough

- FINALIZING ATTACHMENTS UPLOADING IN SUBSCRIPTIONS

ATTACHMENTS
subscriber_id, attachment_type, size, path, created_by, authorized_by, created_at, authorized_at, status


Logs
Keeping logging history
